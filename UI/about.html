            The primary aim of participating in eTutor for your students is to
            provide them with an authentic reason for reading and writing in
            English. For Victorian schools, participation in eTutor also has the
            potential to address the AUSVELS general capability of Intercultural
            Understanding and the cross-curriculum priority of Asia and
            Australia's engagement with Asia.
          </p>

            eTutor is primarily about encouraging English reading and writing
            skills. However, in the 21st century, we cannot ignore the role that
            digital technologies are playing in education around the world. So,
            in eTutor we encourage the students to make use of digital media as
            an alternative to writing in text.

            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>
              E-tutoring is a challenging activity: e-tutors often have a range
              of duties they must carry out and often the workload in e-tutoring
              can be intense. In this activity, you are going to consider the
              variety of tasks which an e-tutor may need to undertake as part of
              their teaching, and then categorise them according to the kind of
              tutoring role that they reflect: social, organisational, or
              pedagogical/intellectual.
